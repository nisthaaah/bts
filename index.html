                Bangtan Sonyeondan also known as the Bulletproof Boy Scouts is a South Korean 
                boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, 
                and Jungkook, who co-write and co-produce the majority of their material. Originally 
                a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres, 
                while their lyricism has focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of 
                school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, 
                and the consequences of fame and recognition. BTS debuted in 2013 under <a href="https://ibighit.com/">Big Hit Entertainment</a> 
                with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool.
